BlockHead
=========

[ContentDB](https://content.minetest.net/packages/SilverSandstone/blockhead/)

This mod lets you put blocks on your head.

Run the `/blockhead` command while holding a block to put it on your head.
Run the command with an empty hand or with the `-r`/`--remove` switch to take
the block off your head.

Use the `-t`/`--top` switch to put the block on top of your head like a hat.

Use the `-b`/`--backwards` switch to rotate the block 180Â°.

If you're in creative mode or you have the `give` privilege, you can put a
specific block on your head with `/blockhead <ItemString>`.
